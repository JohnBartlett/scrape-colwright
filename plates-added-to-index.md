# 🍽️ Plates Type Added to index.html

## ✅ Changes Made

### Modified `renderTypeFilters()` function in `index.html`
- Added logic to include a hardcoded "Plates" filter checkbox
- The "Plates" filter will appear even if no items are categorized as "Plates" yet
- Once items are categorized as "Plates", it will appear naturally in the dynamic list

## 🎯 How It Works

### Before the Change
- Type filters were only generated from existing data
- "Plates" would only appear after items were categorized as such

### After the Change
- "Plates" filter appears immediately in the type filter section
- Users can click "Plates" to filter for items of that type
- When items are categorized as "Plates", they will show up in the filtered results

## 📋 Current Type Filters in index.html
- **Art**
- **Books**

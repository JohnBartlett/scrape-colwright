# 🔐 Tunnel Password Issue - Solutions

## ❌ Problem
LocalTunnel is asking for a password, which makes sharing difficult.

## ✅ Solutions

### Option 1: Get the LocalTunnel Password
Look in your LocalTunnel terminal window for a line like:
```
Tunnel password: xxxxxx
```
Use that password when prompted.

### Option 2: Use Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```
This gives you a URL like: `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`

### Option 3: Use Serveo (Simple)
```bash
ssh -R 80:localhost:3000 serveo.net
```
This gives you a URL like: `https://random-name.serveo.net`

### Option 4: Use ngrok with Free Account
1. Go to: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
2. Get your authtoken
3. Run: `npx ngrok authtoken YOUR_TOKEN`
4. Run: `npx ngrok http 3000`

### Option 5: Use LocalTunnel with Custom Subdomain
```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000 --subdomain colwright-inventory
```

## 🎯 Quick Fix
Try this command in a new terminal:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```
